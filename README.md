# Power BI Project: Flight Tracking

##  Project Overview
This project is a Flight Radar – Airport Departure Report built in Power BI.

The dashboard provides real-time insights into flight departures from different airports around the world, with details on:

 Flight Route Information – Departure and arrival airports with scheduled departure/arrival times.
	
 Airline & Aircraft Details – Airline selection filter, aircraft type, and airline branding.
	
 Weather Insights – Temperature at both departure and arrival airports for flight planning considerations.
	
 Geographical Mapping – Interactive map showing the departure and arrival airport locations.
	
 Flight Activity Status – A breakdown of active flights, landed flights, and scheduled flights.
	
 Aircraft details page - details about the aircraft being used in that specific flight (aircraft's name, use, type, range, seating capacity, aircraft image, airlines that are using this airplane, aircrafts most recent arrival)
